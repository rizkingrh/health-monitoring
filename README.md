# ‚ù§Ô∏è IoT Health Monitoring System ü©∫

## üìã Project Overview
This Health Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution designed to monitor vital health parameters in real-time. Developed as a final project for a Basic Microprocessor course, this system uses the ESP8266 microcontroller coupled with the MAX30100 sensor to measure heart rate and blood oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) non-invasively. The system features dual real-time display capabilities, showing vital signs on both an integrated OLED screen and the Blynk mobile application simultaneously.

Traditional health monitoring often requires expensive medical equipment or frequent visits to healthcare facilities. This project addresses these challenges by creating an affordable, portable, and user-friendly solution that allows individuals to monitor their vital signs. The on-device OLED display provides immediate feedback without requiring a smartphone, while the real-time data transmission to the Blynk application enables remote monitoring and access to health metrics, potentially aiding in early detection of health issues and continuous monitoring for those with existing conditions.
